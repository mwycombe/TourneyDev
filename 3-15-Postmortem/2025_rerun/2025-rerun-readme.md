# 2025 Rerun and Bug Fix
## Most important directory
### Two Files of High Importance

**2025_rerun.rtf**

This contains the menu of the order in which things were done for the rerun

**ChangedModules.rtf**

This is where all the changes that were made are recorded.

The preferred way to apply these changes is to get an empty version of the Tourney App then export the VBA modules from this 2025 Rerun Version and import the VBA modules into a clean version of the app.

A few of the changes will require modification of the xlsx spreadsheet to fix things like incorrect formulas and incorrect Cell Names.
